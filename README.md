Hey, I'm Roast and you may be here after being on my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/roastporkbelly). I'm new to creating mods for Borderlands 2 but wanted a place to share the ones that I have been using on my streams. The main one that I'm working on at the moment is called Butt-er-lands, which works in a similar way to Mopiod's Booperlands to rename the character skill trees and class mods. Many Borderlands streamers have been using Buttsbot in their chat and this mod is inspired by that.

I've only made the changes for Zero and Maya so far and you're welcome to download and run the mod if you like as a kind of beta tester. I'll be posting clear step by step instructions on how to use the mod but for now it's something like this:

* Enable your console by installing BLCMM (link to follow)
* Put the mod file (butt-er-lands.txt) in your Binaries folder
* In the main menu of BL2 type "exec butt-er-lands.txt" in your console and press Enter
